Let's break down this specific line from your `Makefile`:

```makefile
# Rule to compile .c files into .o object files
%.o: %.c header.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@
```

### Explanation:

This is a **pattern rule** in `Makefile` syntax. Pattern rules are a way to specify how to build files of a certain type using a common rule. 

#### Rule Breakdown:

1. **`%.o: %.c header.h`**:
   - `%.o` and `%.c` are **pattern placeholders**. The `%` symbol is a wildcard that matches any filename.
   - The rule says: *"For any `.o` file, look for a corresponding `.c` file with the same name (e.g., `file1.c` → `file1.o`) and compile it."*
   - The `header.h` is also listed here as a dependency, meaning that if `header.h` changes, `make` will recompile the `.c` file into `.o`. This ensures the object files are recompiled if the header file is modified.

   **Example**: If you have `file1.c` and `file1.o`, this rule says:
   - To create `file1.o`, `make` will use `file1.c` (and `header.h` as a dependency).

2. **`$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@`**:
   - **`$(CC)`**: This is the compiler (`gcc` in your case, or whatever is specified by the `CC` variable).
   - **`$(CFLAGS)`**: These are the compiler flags (like `-Wall -g` for warnings and debugging information).
   - **`-c`**: This tells the compiler to **compile** the `.c` file into an object file (`.o`), but not to link it into an executable.
   - **`$<`**: This is an automatic variable in `make`. It represents the **first prerequisite** in the rule (in this case, the `.c` file). So, `$<` will be replaced by the corresponding `.c` file (like `file1.c`).
   - **`-o $@`**: This specifies the **output file**. `$@` is another automatic variable that refers to the target of the rule (in this case, the `.o` file). So, if the target is `file1.o`, `$@` will be replaced by `file1.o`.

   The command `$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@` will then compile the corresponding `.c` file into the `.o` file.

   **Example**:
   - If the rule is triggered for `file1.c`, the command `gcc -Wall -g -c file1.c -o file1.o` will run.

### In Summary:

- **Pattern rule**: This rule defines how to compile any `.c` file into a `.o` (object) file. The pattern `%.o: %.c` means "For any `.o` target, there should be a corresponding `.c` file".
  
- **`$<` and `$@`**: These are **automatic variables**. `$<` refers to the first prerequisite (the `.c` file), and `$@` refers to the target (the `.o` file).
  
- **Dependencies**: The `header.h` is listed as a dependency, meaning that any change to `header.h` will trigger recompilation of the `.c` files.

#### Example of the rule in action:

If you have the following files:
- `file1.c`
- `file2.c`
- `header.h`

Then running `make` would:
1. Compile `file1.c` into `file1.o` (using `header.h` as a dependency).
2. Compile `file2.c` into `file2.o` (again using `header.h`).

This rule allows you to define how to compile any `.c` file into its corresponding `.o` file, without having to write individual rules for each `.c` file.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The line `OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)` is a **pattern substitution** in `Makefile` syntax.

- `SRC` is a list of the source files, e.g., `file1.c file2.c file3.c`.
- `$(SRC:.c=.o)` tells `make` to replace the `.c` extension with `.o` for each file in the `SRC` list.

So, this line converts:
- `file1.c` → `file1.o`
- `file2.c` → `file2.o`
- `file3.c` → `file3.o`

As a result, the `OBJ` variable will hold the list of object files (`file1.o file2.o file3.o`), which are the intermediate files needed for linking the final executable.

### In summary:
- **Before**: `SRC = file1.c file2.c file3.c`
- **After**: `OBJ = file1.o file2.o file3.o`

This is a shorthand way to generate object files from corresponding source files.

Let's break down the lines you've highlighted in the `Makefile`.

### `all: $(EXEC)`

- **`all`** is a **target** in the `Makefile`. In a `Makefile`, targets are usually the files or tasks you want to build or perform.
- **`$(EXEC)`** is the **dependency** for the `all` target. It refers to the final executable file you want to create (defined by `EXEC = program`).
  
So, this line means: *"When you run `make`, it will try to build the target `all`, which depends on the target `$(EXEC)` (in this case, `program`).*

In other words:
- When you run `make` without specifying a target, `make` will look for the default target, which in this case is `all`. 
- Since `all` depends on `$(EXEC)` (i.e., `program`), `make` will then attempt to build the `program` executable.

---

### `$(EXEC): $(OBJ)`

- This line defines a **rule** for how to build the target `$(EXEC)` (the executable). It says that to create `$(EXEC)`, it depends on the object files `$(OBJ)` (i.e., the `.o` files). 
- **`$(OBJ)`** is a variable that holds the list of object files (`file1.o`, `file2.o`, `file3.o`), which are compiled from the source files (`file1.c`, `file2.c`, `file3.c`).
  
This means that **`$(EXEC)`** (the executable) can only be created if **the object files** are up-to-date (i.e., compiled from the `.c` files).

---

### `$(CC) $(OBJ) -o $(EXEC)`

- **`$(CC)`** refers to the **compiler** (in this case, `gcc`), as defined earlier in the `Makefile`.
- **`$(OBJ)`** is the list of object files (like `file1.o file2.o file3.o`).
- **`-o $(EXEC)`** tells the compiler to output the final result to the file `$(EXEC)` (in this case, `program`).

So, this line is the **linking step**: it links all the object files into the final executable `$(EXEC)`.

In full:
- The rule says: *To create the final executable (`program`), run the compiler on the object files and output the result to the executable file `program`.*

---

### Full Explanation of These Lines:

```makefile
all: $(EXEC)
```
- When `make` is run, it will first check if the target `$(EXEC)` (which is `program`) is up-to-date.
  
```makefile
$(EXEC): $(OBJ)
	$(CC) $(OBJ) -o $(EXEC)
```
- To create the `program` executable (`$(EXEC)`), `make` will use the compiler (`$(CC)`) and link together all the object files (`$(OBJ)`). The resulting executable will be named `program`.

### Recap:

- `all: $(EXEC)` means that the default target `all` depends on the executable `$(EXEC)`, which is `program` in this case.
- `$(EXEC): $(OBJ)` means that the executable depends on the object files (`$(OBJ)`).
- The command `$(CC) $(OBJ) -o $(EXEC)` links the object files into the final executable `program`.
