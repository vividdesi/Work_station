creating obj files ->
 gcc -c lib_add.c lib_sub.c -fpic
 
 
 creating dynamic lib by using obj files->
 gcc *.o -shared -o lib_cal.so
 
 
 linking dynamic library to excutable file->
 
 gcc main.c -o main -L. -l_cal
 
 there may be an error of crsting of obl file of main
 
 to solve this we can use
 gcc -c main.c main.o
 
 there are 2 methods to solve errors ->
 
 I)cp dyn_lib into the root folder
    sudo cp lib_cal.so /usr/lib
    
 II)u can use export cmd
    
    first->use pwd to copy the directory location
    second_>use export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:PWD
