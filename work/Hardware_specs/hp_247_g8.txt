Doubts int the specs -

*TDP (Thermal Design Power) refers to the maximum amount of heat a processor or chip is expected to generate under typical workload conditions

*Threads allow a single core to handle multiple tasks efficiently, improving multitasking and overall performance.

	Example: An 8-core CPU with 16 threads can process 16 instruction sets simultaneously.

*A CPU cache is a small but very fast memory that stores frequently used instructions and data to reduce access time from RAM.
