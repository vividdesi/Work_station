### **Difference Between Inline Functions and Macros**

#### **1. Macros**
- **Definition:**  
  Preprocessor directives used for text substitution before compilation.  
  Example:  
  ```c
  #define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))
  ```

- **Characteristics:**  
  - Processed by the preprocessor (text replacement).  
  - No type checking.  
  - Can cause unintended behavior due to side effects.  

- **Advantages:**  
  - No function call overhead.  
  - Useful for constants and conditional compilation.  

- **Disadvantages:**  
  - No scope or type checking, leading to potential bugs.  
  - Difficult to debug as they donâ€™t appear in the stack trace.  
  - Increases code size due to repeated expansion (code bloat).

#### **2. Inline Functions**
- **Definition:**  
  Functions suggested to the compiler for inline substitution of the function body.  
  Example:  
  ```c
  inline int square(int x) {
      return x * x;
  }
  ```

- **Characteristics:**  
  - Handled by the compiler (not guaranteed to be inlined).  
  - Type checking is done like regular functions.  
  - Scoped and follows normal function rules.  

- **Advantages:**  
  - Type-safe and debuggable.  
  - Reduces side effects compared to macros.  
  - Optimized by the compiler for efficiency.  

- **Disadvantages:**  
  - May increase code size if used excessively.  
  - Slightly more verbose than macros.

### **Comparison Table**

| **Feature**        | **Macros**                        | **Inline Functions**              |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Definition**      | Preprocessor directive (`#define`).| Function with `inline` keyword.   |
| **Type Checking**   | Not performed.                   | Performed.                        |
| **Scope**           | No scope, global substitution.   | Follows function scope.           |
| **Debugging**       | Hard to debug (text replaced).    | Easier to debug (function body).  |
| **Side Effects**    | Prone to side effects.            | Less prone to side effects.       |
| **Efficiency**      | No function call overhead.        | Optimized by the compiler.        |
| **Use Cases**       | Constants, conditional code.      | Type-safe reusable code blocks.   |

### **Which is Better?**
1. **Use Inline Functions:**
   - For reusable and type-safe code.  
   - When debugging and maintenance are required.  

2. **Use Macros:**
   - For constants (though `const` or `enum` is preferred).  
   - For conditional compilation (`#ifdef`, `#define`).  

#### **Recommendation:**  
Prefer **inline functions** in modern C/C++ programming for safety, maintainability, and debugging. Use macros sparingly for specific use cases.
